# Ubuntu dock tweaker CLI/TUI
The goal of the project is to make it possible to tweak Ubuntu dock with no GUI app installed, all you have to do is to run the script

## How to use it?
First of all, you need to 
```
git clone https://github.com/LambLeeg/Ubuntu-dock-tweaker-CLI-TUI.git
```
 from a terminal within the dirrectory you want it to be.

Now, open the cloned folder in a terminal, and write 
```
./Ubuntu\'s\ Dock\ tweaks.py 
``` 

## What it can do?
At the moment, it can enable "Minimize on click" and/or enable "Move application menu on top of the dock"

### Will it have something else?
Well, in a nutshell, yes; I am going to add some stuff

## Troubleshooting
There is a little chance that cloned files won't work, then just use 
```
chmod +x Ubuntu\'s\ Dock\ tweaks.py
```
 at the cloned folder, and now give it a second shot!
