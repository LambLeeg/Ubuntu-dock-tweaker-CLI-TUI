# Ubuntu dock tweaker CLI/TUI
The goal of the project is to make it possible to tweak Ubuntu dock with no GUI app installed, all you have to do is to run the script

## How to use it?
First of all, you need to 
```
git clone https://github.com/LambLeeg/Ubuntu-dock-tweaker-CLI-TUI.git
```
 from a terminal within the dirrectory you want it to be.

Now, open the cloned folder in a terminal, and write 
```
./tweaker.py 
```

## Will it have something else?
Well, in a nutshell, yes; I am going to add some stuff

```
 at the cloned folder, and now give it a second shot!
