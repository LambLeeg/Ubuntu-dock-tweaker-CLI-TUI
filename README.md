# Ubuntu dock tweaker CLI/TUI
The goal of the project is to make it possible to tweak Ubuntu dock with no GUI app installed, all you have to do is to run the script

![This is how Dock tweaker looks like](TheLook.png)

## How to use it?
First of all, you need to 
```
git clone https://github.com/LambLeeg/Ubuntu-dock-tweaker-CLI-TUI.git
```
 from a terminal within the dirrectory you want it to be.

1. Now, open the cloned folder in a terminal, and write `./tweaker.py`
2. The second method (recommended) is to open Files and right click the `tweaker.py`, then click "Run as a program" (works for Ubuntu)

## QA
1. How it works?
- These are simple, and easy to write Python files; they are made as modules to ease the coding

2. Why would I use it?
- Well, it's made for people who want a program that is not relying on GUI but makes its work

3. Why it's FOSS?
- Because I do believe that free and open source is the power of a code

## Will it have something else?
Well, in a nutshell - yes; I am going to add some stuff

## Troubleshooting
There is a little chance that cloned files won't work, then just use `chmod +x tweaker.py` at the cloned folder or right click `tweaker.py` --> Properties --> Permissions --> Allow executing file as a program, and now give it a second shot!
